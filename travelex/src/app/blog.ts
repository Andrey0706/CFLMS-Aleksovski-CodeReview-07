Mykonos is famed for beautiful beaches, fantastic seafood, romantic resorts, and a crazy party scene. It is a popular tourist spot amongst the wealthy and many celebrities! While it’s an excellent honeymoon destination, the summer crowds tend to be young people looking for a good time.

Language: The official language is Greek, but English is widely spoken.

Currency: The Euro is used as currency (€). Currently, $1 U.S. dollar will get you €.86 in Euros.

Climate: Hot dry summers and mild winter with constant winds.

Rainy season: Rain is very scarce in Mykonos, but showers can occur between Oct – April.

title: "Ancient olimpia",
content: "This is where the Olympic Games took place every four years for over 1100 years, until their abolition by Emperor Theodosius I in AD 393. The Olympic flame is still lit here for the modern Games. Thanks to the destruction ordered by Theodosius II in AD 420 and various subsequent earthquakes, little remains of the magnificent temples and athletic facilities, but enough exists to give you a hint of the sanctuary's former glory. It is one of Greece's most evocative ancient sites. Wandering amid the tree-shaded ruins, you can almost picture the blood and smoke of oxen sacrificed to Zeus and Hera, the sweaty, oiled-up athletes waiting inside the original stadium, the jostling crowds, and the women and slaves watching the proceedings from a nearby hill. It's worth remembering that some structures precede others by centuries; a visit to the archaeological museum before or after will provide context and help with visualising the ancient buildings.",

title: "Ancient Mycenae",
content: "On a hilltop backed by powerful mountains stand the sombre and mighty ruins of Ancient Mycenae, home of the legendary Agamemnon. For four centuries in the second millennium BC, this kingdom was the most powerful in Greece, holding sway over the Argolid and influencing other Mycenaean cities.World Heritage–listed Mycenae is synonymous with the names Homer and Schliemann. In the 9th century BC Homer told in his epic poems, 'Iliad' and 'Odyssey', of ‘well-built Mycenae, rich in gold’. These poems were, until the 19th century, regarded as no more than gripping and beautiful legends. But in the 1870s the amateur archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann (1822–90), despite derision from professionals, struck gold, first at Troy then at Mycenae.",

title: "Parthenon",
content: "Designed to be the pre-eminent monument of the Acropolis, the Parthenon epitomises the glory of Ancient Greece. Meaning 'virgin's apartment', it's dedicated to Athena Parthenos, the goddess embodying the power and prestige of the city. The largest Doric temple ever completed in Greece, the Parthenon took 15 years to build.It was designed by Iktinos and Kallicrates and completed in time for the Great Panathenaic Festival of 438 BC. Built on its highest ground of the Acropolis, the Parthenon had a dual purpose: to house the great statue of Athena commissioned by Pericles and to serve as the new treasury. It was built on the site of at least three earlier temples dedicated to Athena. The temple consisted of eight fluted Doric columns at either end and 17 on each side. To achieve perfect form, its lines were ingeniously curved to create an optical illusion – the foundations are slightly concave and the columns are slightly convex to make both look straight. Supervised by Pheidias, sculptors worked on the architectural detail of the Parthenon, including the pediments and friezes, which were brightly coloured and gilded.",
